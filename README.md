# California_Housing_Prices

* **Predictive Analysis of California Housing Prices**
    * Developed a linear regression model using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) to predict median housing prices based on demographic and geographic features from the California Housing dataset.
    * Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature importance assessment, and model training, achieving an R-squared of approximately 0.60 on the test set.
    * Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ², and visualized predictions against actual values to assess accuracy.
    * *Technologies:* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
